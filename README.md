# DWX.PortableApps.Logging

This library contains sample code how to wrap multiple kinds of loggers into one abstract logger that can be used instead of a specific logging framework. The logging frameworks are just plugged in by implementing the ILogger and ILogManager interfaces. There is sample implementations for MetroLog and ApplicationInsights already available.
